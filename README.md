Use [JSONPath expressions](https://github.com/dchester/jsonpath#jsonpath-syntax) to extract and filter data from JSON objects.

Check out https://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki/For-JSONPath-users for a comparison between JSONPath and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

## Features
Two commands are available through the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette). With a .json file open, type `jsonpath` to bring them up:

### `jsonPath: Extract JSON data` 

Filter JSON data.

### `jsonPath: Extract JSON data with their paths` 

Filter JSON data and display the path to filtered data.
